# TK-Auto
Simple tkinter autoclicker built with python

## Packages required
```python
pip install keyboard
pip install tkinter
pip install time
pip install pyautogui
```

## How to use
Upon running the file you will notice that a window will appear titled "Autoclicker v4". You'll see three label boxes named:
<ul>
  <li>Delays (this is used to control the rate at which the auto clicker clicks)</li>
  <li>Controls (this is used to control the mouse button that the auto clicker will trigger, by default it is set on left click. Additionally this section controls the start and stop of the auto clicker)</li>
  <li>Repeats (this is section is used to change how many times the auto clicker clicks or if it clicks until you tell it to stop)</li>
</ul>
Since the program takes a short time to process the click the delay will never be perfect. The fastest I was able to operate the auto clicker was at 10 clicks per second on a 0 millisecond delay
